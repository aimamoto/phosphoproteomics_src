The R Scripts are numbered for the order of execution, though some parts may be redundant to add cosmetic improvements. The directory and initial input names are given for local settings designed to run in Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 LTR and may need to be updated for specific environment.

Please note that A0-B2 scripts are not used to generate results shown in the manuscript.
